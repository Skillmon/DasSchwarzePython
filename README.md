This is a module of functions and stuff for playing Das Schwarze Auge, a German
Pen&Paper roll playing game.

The module is in early development status. I don't know how much I will add to
this over time or if I loose interest in this.

The project is licensed under the GPLv3 or later. This covers only the
implementation. I don't own the rights of Das Schwarze Auge nor am I in any way
affiliated with it or its license holders, anything related to the game such as
rules or names is not covered by the GPL.


Known issues:

The rules in proben.py are not correct as of now. Special abilities, advantages
and disadvantages of heroes are not considered automatically. Most likely much
more.
